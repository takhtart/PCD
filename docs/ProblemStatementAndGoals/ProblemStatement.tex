\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Our team aims to design a software that can reliably detect a person’s body from sensor data even if they are blocked by another person or other objects, which existing solutions cannot reliably do so. This helps make future assistive robots with arms designed to help people in their daily lives much safer for the user.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
The software will take in real-time data from a Kinect sensor or uploaded data files and return the location of visible parts of a person in the coloured point cloud and an estimation of the 3D space that are occupied by the head, horso and limbs.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
Dr Gary Bone wishes to create a solution for future mobile robots with arms to recognize their surroundings and identify the spaces that are occupied by the people around them. This way, these assistive robots can be used to help people at their homes. Our solution could be used by robotics companies to develop their robots.

\subsection{Environment}
The software must work in conjunction with the microsoft kinect in real-time. Additionally, the software must be designed using C++ and/or Python and will be designed to work in the Windows operating system.

\section{Goals}   
        \begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|  }
        \hline
        Goals & Explanation & Importance \\
        \hline
        Identifying Humans & The program needs to able to detect a human within a given environment.     & 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item This goal is important  as its the main function of the program
        \item Being able to detect human helps with finding the location of the person 
        \end{itemize}\\
        \hline
        Be able to outline a human & The program needs to be able to create a rough outline based on where it believes a human is.    & 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Its important to understand the basic outline of the human so that the robot is able to create a basic understanding of where they are hidden
        \end{itemize}\\
        \hline
        Real-time Processing & The program needs to be able to process what it sees in real time and present its data as it sees it. & 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The environment is constantly changing and needs to able to output real time results
        \item Its important that the output displays real time results because it is important that the robot is able to constantly adapt to the environment 
        \end{itemize}\\
        \hline
        Be able to capture  PCD from the sensor   & The program uses PCD data to identify a human in the present environment & 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item This data needs to be collected properly so that it can be processed
        \item Without this data the program/robot will not be able to properly detect the humans
        \end{itemize}\\
        \hline
        Be able to analyze PCD files & The program should be able to analyze PCD files that are uploaded rather than captured in real time. & 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Controlled scenarios could be easily tested to ensure proper results and also allow for specific configuration
        \end{itemize}\\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        

\section{Stretch Goals}
    \begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|  }
    \hline
    Goals & Explanation & Importance \\
    \hline
    Detect Humans Fully covered in clothing  & When a human is fully covered their skin color is no longer visible which would make it more difficult to detect the person.     & 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In more dangerous scenarios it would be highly likely that some humans may be wearing full body suits for protection
      \item Also this would allow for a system that isn’t solely dependent on skin color to detect humans 
    \end{itemize}\\
    \hline
    Mapping the environment & Being able to identify other objects that are present within the environment    & 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Being able to identify objects would allow for a better understanding of the environment and where the person is hidden 
    \end{itemize}\\
    \hline
    Humanoid Outline & Creating a realistic outline that shows a humanoid figure in a 3D plane    & 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Creating a more humanoid outline will give proper dimensions to the person hidden in the frame
      \item This would allow for more accurate detection and human depiction 
    \end{itemize}\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level of the project is considered to be general. The project consists of topics 
already covered within previous year courses. Majority of the project fits into the group's domain
 and should be achievable. However, there is a learning curve with the computer vision aspect of 
 the program. The two extras that the project will cover is design thinking and the user manual.
