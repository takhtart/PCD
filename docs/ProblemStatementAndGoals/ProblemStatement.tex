\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Our team aims to design a software that can reliably detect a person’s body from Point Cloud Data (PCD) even if they are blocked by another person or other objects, which existing solutions cannot reliably do so. This helps make future assistive robots with arms designed to help people in their daily lives much safer for the user.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
The software will take in real-time data from a Kinect sensor or uploaded Point Cloud Data (PCD) files and return the location of visible parts of a person in the coloured point cloud and an estimation of the 3D space that are occupied by the head, torso and limbs.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
Dr.Gary Bone wishes to create a solution for robots to recognize their surroundings and identify the spaces that are occupied by the people around them. This way, these assistive robots can be used to help people at their homes. Our solution could be used by robotics companies to develop their robots.

\subsection{Environment}
The software must work in conjunction with the Microsoft Kinect in real-time. Additionally, the software will be designed to work in the Windows operating system.

\section{Goals}   

\subsection{Identifying a Person}
The application should be able to identify a human within a variety of different environments. This includes detecting the human even if they are partially obscured by an object.

\subsection{Model Identified Person using Shapes}
The application should be able to provide a rough model based on where it believes the person is in 3D space. A rough shape of the head, torso, and limbs will be shown on the screen to help provide an accurate location of the human on screen.

\subsection{Real-time Processing}
The application needs to be able to process the data and constantly be updating to see if a human is detected within frame. The reading and processing of the data needs to be done with minimal latency.

\subsection{Location Precision}
The application is able to provide the spatial coordinate of the person. This would help with visualizing the human within a 3D space and provide the robot with a better understanding of where the person is from its current location.

\subsection{Analyze and Process offline PCD files}
The application should be able to take uploaded Point Cloud Data files as an input rather than analyzing captured data in real-time. This allows for the testing of various controlled scenarios to ensure that the program can successfully identify a human in different scenarios. Outputs of the application can be easily compared to the expected results of the configured scenario to determine accuracy.

\section{Stretch Goals}

\subsection{Mapping the environment}
The application should be able to identify other objects that are present within the environment. Having a better understanding of the environment means that the application would provide better spatial awareness by disregarding objects as being possible body parts.

\subsection{Drawing a Humanoid Outline}
The application should be able to create a realistic outline with humanoid features for the people it identifies. A more accurate outline provides greater dimension and distinction between what is and isn’t part of the human body. This would allow for a more accurate detection and human depiction.
  

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level of this project is currently set to Advanced/Research level. The project consists of topics 
that aren't covered within previous year courses, and the majority of the project doesn't fit into the group's current domain knowledge on computer vision and point cloud data manipulation. 
There is a learning curve with the computer vision aspect of the program, as we will have to quickly learn and apply libraries and techniques that are novel to us. As our project is advanced, the only extra will be a research manual.
