\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Our team aims to design a software that can reliably detect a personâ€™s body from sensor data even if they are blocked by another person or other objects, which existing solutions cannot reliably do so. This helps make future assistive robots with arms designed to help people in their daily lives much safer for the user.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
The software will take in real-time data from a Kinect sensor or uploaded data files and return the location of visible parts of a person in the coloured point cloud and an estimation of the 3D space that are occupied by the head, horso and limbs.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
Dr Gary Bone wishes to create a solution for future mobile robots with arms to recognize their surroundings and identify the spaces that are occupied by the people around them. This way, these assistive robots can be used to help people at their homes. Our solution could be used by robotics companies to develop their robots.

\subsection{Environment}
The software must work in conjunction with the microsoft kinect in real-time. Additionally, he software must be designed using C++ and/or Python and will be designed to work in the Windows operating system.


\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
