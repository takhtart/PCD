This document outlines the Verification and Validation  plan for our software project. 
The purpose of this plan is to increase confidence in our software by ensuring it meets its requirements and performs as expected. 
This plan will list our objectives and processes related to verification and validation of our system and our roadmap for doing so.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The software being tested is our Partially Covered Detection (PCD) system. 
The system leverages depth and RGB layers to form a combined coloured point cloud, which is then analyzed to accurately detect individuals even when they are not fully visible. 
Detection can occur in a live setting through a Kinect, or using offline file captures.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objective of this VnV plan is to ensure the system's correctness and performance, verifying both its functional and non-functional requirements. 
This involves testing the system's ability to accurately identify partially obscured individuals and demonstrate that it operates efficiently within its environment. 
Additionally, the plan aims to ensure that the system implementation matches the project specifications. Testing within dark environments is considered out of scope, as RGB data cannot be captured in such settings. 
Furthermore, the project assumes that any external libraries used have already been verified by their respective implementation teams.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for this project is advanced, as agreed upon with our assigned TA. A User Manual and Design Thinking additions are our included extras.

\section{Plan}

This section describes the overall plan for the verification and validation of our system. It includes the work breakdown 
of each member of the verification and validation team. This section also outlines the plans for the verification of 
our SRS, Design, and VnV. Furthermore, it details the plans for the implementation of these verification strategies as well as 
the implementation of the testing tools and the software validation plan.

  \end{table}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The current plan to verify our SRS involves incorporating both self-review and peer-review feedback, used in tandem with notes from our TA 
and a final read-over with our supervisor. Our team will first do a quick read-through of each other's sections and provide feedback for changes
in the form of comments on the issue. We will then incorporate the feedback we receive from our peers in another group, delivered to us via 
separate Github issues. These issues will be assigned to a single member of the team, who will have the responsibility of finishing and closing it.
Additionally, we will create issues related to the feedback we received from our TA and work on adding the corresponding changes to our SRS. 
Finally, after incorporating all the feedback received, we will host a meeting with Dr. Bone. In this meeting, the team will walk Dr. Bone through
our SRS and get his opinion on any final changes that need to be made to our requirements. Issues will be created to address the requested changes.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Like the SRS, the plan for design verification includes a team review, a peer review, and a TA review. Like the SRS, the 
team review will involve team members reviewing another team member's section and commenting on changes that should be made. 
The peer review will similarly consist of another team adding Github issues to our repository and getting assigned to a team member. 
At that time, the specified team member will complete and close the issue. Additionally, we will incorporate issues raised by our TA. 

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Similarly to the previous plans, this one will consist of a team review, a peer review, and a TA review, as well as a review from our
supervisor. Just as the previous plans, the team, peer, and TA review will be conducted in the same way as previously mentioned. Additionally,
for this verification plan, we will also be including our supervisor, Dr. Bone. The team will schedule a meeting with him and go through
specific parts of the document. These parts will be our plan for what automated tests we are implementing, and Dr. Bone will have the final word
on any improvements or changes we should make before proceeding.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

For the automated testing, cppunit will be used as it provides a simple and portable way to unit test the system. When it comes to doing coverage testing it would be best to use GCov because it is compatible with VScode and easier to set up compared to other applications. The main coverage focus for the project would be MC/DC coverage because it is a good coverage test for complicated decisions which the PCD system will have to make.
Linters are also a good tool to help ensure all the code meets a certain standard that is respected within the field. For this project, Clang-Tidy will be used because it is compatible with VS code and meets the standards within the industry for C++.


\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

For software validation, we will be providing Dr. Bone with bi-weekly written updates on the progress of the project. These updates
will serve as a brief validation that our software matches the aforementioned requirements outlined in the SRS. These smaller written checkups serve
as an iterative way to validate the software against the requirements by constantly getting input from Dr. Bone about new code.
Larger releases, such as code milestones or demos, will be accompanied by a meeting with Dr. Bone instead of a written update. 
These meetings will be lead by the main developers of the corresponding section and serve as the main form of software validation. 
The team will also consider peer feedback and TA/prof feedback from the demo to determine if the software accomplishes its goals.

\section{System Tests}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs.  Output is not how you
are going to return the results of the test.  The output is the expected
result.}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: 
					
Input/Condition: 
					
Output/Result: 
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Module ?}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
