\section{Introduction}

This document contains details of our Hazard Analysis on our Partially Covered Detection software system. 
A hazard will be defined as a condition or situation where privacy, security, and/or system reliability may be compromised.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of this Hazard Analysis is to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks associated with the 
Partial Covered Detection software system. By identifying the associated hazards, we can further ensure the privacy 
and security of users and their data, and increase the reliability of the system.

The scope of this analysis includes the entire lifecycle of the detection system. This entails the planning, 
development, deployment, and maintenance phases of the software cycle.\\
\\
\textbf{Potential Losses Due to Hazards}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Privacy Violations:} Unauthorized capture and storage of point cloud data by the Kinect sensor, 
without permission from parties present in the capture could lead to breaches of user privacy. 
This may lead to potential legal repercussions due to non-compliance with data protection regulations.

\item \textbf{Legal and Regulatory Consequences:} Non-compliance with data protection laws and regulations may incur fines and legal actions.


\item \textbf{Operational Disruptions:} Any failure in system performance, such as incorrect data 
inputs/outputs or unresponsiveness could disrupt critical operations, leading to reduced functionality in 
real-time applications.

\end{enumerate}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

The application is divided into three components
\subsection{Human Detection System}
The application can read in data and provide the location of the human.
The system will provide the information needed to map the head, torso, and/or limbs.
\subsection{Human Outline System}
The application maps out the outline of the human within the environment.
\subsection{File Manager System}
The application takes in information from either the offline file or the kinect sensor and filters out the noise from the files.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

The application must encrypt user entered files.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} This is to ensure the privacy of the files uploaded by the user

The application must not store any files uploaded.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} This is to ensure that in case of any data breach the files will not be something an attacker could have access to.

The application must not store the .pcd files sent from the live Kinect.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To ensure that the live sensor data protects the user's privacy within the environment.

The application must reject any foreign or unexpected file formats.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} This is to ensure that our program will not have any unexpected behaviour following improper use.

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

In terms of the the roadmap, we will be implementing some of the newly discovered requirements while leaving others for future plans. During this capstone,
we will ensure that files will not be stored and that unexpected file formats will not be allowed to be uploaded. In the future, past the scope of this capstone,
we would implement some form of data encryption on all files that go into our system, as well as output files generated.
