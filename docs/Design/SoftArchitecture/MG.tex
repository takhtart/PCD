\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
  hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acConstraintIn}:] The constraints on
  the input parameters.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acConstraintOut}:] The constraints on
  the output results.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acProcess}:] The classification model 
  used to determine the presence of a human.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File, Kinect, and Keyboard, Output: File, Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] There will always
  be a source of input data external to the software.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutput}:] Output data will
  always be displayed to the output device.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGoal}:] The goal of the system
  is to accurately detect and identify presence of a human.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucFormatIn}:] The format of the 
  initial input data.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucFormatParam}:] The format of the 
  input parameters.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucFormatOut}:] The format of the
  final output data.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\noindent{For Rev 0, the prioritization of the modules are as follows:} \\

\noindent{\textbf{High Priority:}}\\
Application Control\\
Input Data Read\\
Input Classifier\\
Point Cloud Data Structures\\
\\
\textbf{Medium Priority:}\\
Input Classifier Ranking\\
Input Processing\\
\\
\textbf{Low Priority:}\\
Bounding Box Display\\
Command Line Interface\\
Graphical User Interface\\
\\
\textbf{Already Implemented:}\\
Hardware-Hiding\\
Kinect Stream\\

The modules under high priority are directly related to the performance of the human detection. Specifically, reading in the data, controlling the
application, classifying the detection strategy, and handling the data structures are all integral to the functioning of the human detection. 
Input Processing and Classifier Ranking are medium as they would be nice to have, but are not necessary for the application to work. Processing the input 
to remove noise and false positives is important to have, but not integral. Finally, low priority modules are ones that are partially implemented but may
need to be changed as the algorithm develops. We have a useable CLI and GUI, and the bounding box displays works at a rudimentary level. They will need to be 
updated for the final submission but are passable for now. Finally, hardware-hiding and the Kinect stream are already implemented properly in our code.

As there are 4 modules that make up high-priority, we will have one team member primarily focusing their time on one module. Upon completion the ones that finished
will provide assistance to the others until all high-priority modules are completed. If there is still time after, we will divide up the remaining modules based on 
availability.

For testing of these modules, since all the high-priority modules pertain to human detection, after implementing them we will execute our person detection tests. This means 
that we will be performing a series of manual tests to ensure that the person detection implemented is correct and reliable. These manual tests can be found in further detail in our
VnV plan.
