The purpose of reflection questions is to give you a chance to assess your own
learning and that of your group as a whole, and to find ways to improve in the
future. Reflection is an important part of the learning process.  Reflection is
also an essential component of a successful software development process.  

Reflections are most interesting and useful when they're honest, even if the
stories they tell are imperfect. You will be marked based on your depth of
thought and analysis, and not based on the content of the reflections
themselves. Thus, for full marks we encourage you to answer openly and honestly
and to avoid simply writing ``what you think the evaluator wants to hear.''

Please answer the following questions.  Some questions can be answered on the
team level, but where appropriate, each team member should write their own
response:
\\
Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the project?\\

It is important to create a development plan prior to starting the project because
it allows most of the heavy lifting behind project planning to be done before any
work has started. It allows for expectations and workflow to be clearly defined before
any issues arise. It also creates a document that can be referenced at other times 
to avoid confusion.\\
\\
In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using CI/CD?\\

Employing CI/CD allows for better issue tracking and rollbacks. Utilizing CI/CD gives the
opportunity for teams to better track individual issues and commits, leading to increased 
awareness and visibility on workflow issues. It also allows for easier time rolling back
to a previous version in case something goes wrong. 
Some disadvantages are with the conceptual depth and speed. Ensuring a specific workflow 
and constant PR reviews can slow things down as contributors have to make sure that they
are following the workflow properly and have to wait for PR reviews (when necessary). Furthermore,
it is more effort to set up, both in the codebase and conceptually. The process has to be 
talked through and understood by all team members.\\
\\
What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any, and how did you resolve them?\\

Our group mainly debated how to set up our GitHub workflows. Initially, we considered using individual branches for each issue, but we ultimately decided on a 
more streamlined approach with two revision branches and separate forks. This allows us to effectively manage pull requests for merging feature changes into the codebase. 
We reached this agreement after discussing the benefits of clarity and collaboration in our development process.
