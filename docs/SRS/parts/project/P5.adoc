TIP: _External systems, hardware and software, expected to be necessary for building the system. It lists external technology elements, such as program libraries and hardware devices, that the project is expected to require. Although the actual use of such products belongs to design and implementation rather than requirements, it is part of the requirements task to identify elements whose availability is critical to the success of the project â€” an important element of risk analysis (<<p6>>)._  <<BM22>>
