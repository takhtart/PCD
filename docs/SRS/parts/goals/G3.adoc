TIP: _New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the project’s results. It presents the business benefits expected from the successful execution of the project. **This chapter is the core of the Goals book**, describing what the organization expects from the system. It ensures that the project remains focused: if at some stage it gets pushed in different directions, with “creeping featurism” threatening its integrity, a reminder about the original business goals stated in those chapters will help._  <<BM22>>

From successful execution of the project, we hope to achieve the following benefits:

*Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction:* By developing software that can reliably detect partially hidden people, the project will improve the safety and effectiveness of human-robot interactions by increasing the awareness capabilities of the robot.

*Real-Time and Offline Processing:* The ability to process data in real-time using a Kinect sensor, as well as offline using 
.pcd files, will provide flexibility for the user to view detection live, or view detection results using previously captured data. This ensures that the system can be tested and used in different scenarios, enhancing its robustness and reliability.

*Improved Skeleton Tracking:* The project aims to overcome the limitations of the existing skeleton tracking offered by the Kinect SDK by providing more advanced estimations of a person's body, even when partially obstructed. This improvement will be beneficial for robotics applications.

*Versatility in Body Poses and Scenarios:* The software will be tested against a variety of cases. For example a person in frame may not ne facing the sensor directly, could be in a different position, or be partially obstructed by objects or other individuals. Being able to accommodate in these situations will make the system more adaptable to real life situations, and have more practical value.

*Contribution to Research and Development:* The project will contribute to the broader field of robotics and computer vision by addressing a challenging problem with a real world application and provide a potential solution. This can pave the way for further research and development in assistive robotics and related areas in the future.
