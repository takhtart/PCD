=== (S.5) Prioritization

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Classification of the behaviors, interfaces and scenarios (<<s2>>, <<s3>> and <<s4>>) by their degree of criticality. It is useful in particular if during the course of the project various pressures force the team to drop certain functions._  <<BM22>>

==== Priority Table for Human Outline Manager
|===

|Requirement ID | Requirement | MoSCoW Classification | Summary 

| <<F211>> | Display the human outline | Must have | It is important to be able to show on the screen where the person is hidden.
| <<NF212>> | Speed and Latency | Must have | It must be able to present all the environmental and camera changes in real time.
| <<NF211>> | Appearance/Style | Could have | It could have a minimalistic design to make reading the data easier. It is not necessary, but would make the output more clear.

==== Priority Table for Human Detection Algorithm
|===

|Requirement ID | Requirement | MoSCoW Classification | Summary 
| <<F221>> | Locate Visible Human Parts | Must have | It is important that the algorithm is able to locate where the visible part of the human is.
| <<F222>> | Estimate Hidden Human Parts | Must have | It is important that the algorithm is able to take the visible parts and then estimate where it believes the rest of the human would be.
| <<NF221>> | Speed and Latency | Must have | It must be able to calculate everything in real time to present the newest location and outline.
| <<NF222>> | Accuracy | Must have | It must give an accurate location and outline.
| <<NF223>> | Reliability | Must have | It must have an algorithm that has a low failure rate and make sure that the latest, most accurate data is shown.

==== Priority Table for Kinect Manager
|===

|Requirement ID | Requirement | MoSCoW Classification | Summary 
| <<F231>> | Read the Point Cloud Data | Must have | It is important that the manager is able to properly read in the data from the Kinect sensor and combine the two data sets together.
| <<F232>> | Send Data back to Algorithm | Must have | It is important that the data sent back to the algorithm accounts for the noise in the environment and that the data being sent is the latest.
| <<NF231>> | Speed and Latency | Must have | It must regulate the noise and send the data as fast as possible so that the application is in real time.
| <<NF232>> | Accuracy | Must have | It must give back accurate data so that the application does not fail.
