=== (S.2) Functionality

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**‚Äù. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.2.1) Human Outline Display:

*Functional Requirements:*

. [[F211]] *Display the human outline*:  The application displays the real time data as a 3D point cloud and showcases the location of the human within the data set. (F211)

*Non-Functional Requirements:*

. [[NF211]] *Appearance/Style of Display*: The application must have a design that is minimalistic. (NF211)
*Rational*: The application should only display necessary items on screen such as the point cloud data and the human outline. The minimalist design will allow for easily readable data.

. [[NF212]] *Speed and Latency of Display*: The application must update the location of the human within __ milliseconds. (NF212)
*Rational*: The expectations of a live display is that the application presents all information seamlessly and without any noticeable delay.

==== (S.2.2) Human Detection Algorithm:
*Functional Requirements:*

. [[F221]] *Locate Visible Human Parts*: The application must use the data set provided and calculate the location of the visible parts of the person in the environment. (F221)

. [[F222]] *Estimate Hidden Human Parts*: The application must use the data to estimate where the non visible part of the person is.

*Non-Functional Requirements:*

. [[NF221]] *Speed and Latency*: The application must process the data and find the human in every other frame. (NF221)
*Rational*: Human detection must be processed within real time.

. [[NF222]] *Accuracy*: The application must be able to detect humans with 85% accuracy. (NF222)

. [[NF223]] *Reliability*: The application performs with a success rate of 90%. (NF223)
*Rational*: The application is able to operate will a low failure rate so that the data presented is accurate


==== (S.2.3) Kinect Manager:
*Functional Requirements:*

. [[F231]] *Read the Point Cloud Data*: The Kinect manager should be able to process the noise within the data to present a readable data set for the application. (F231)

. [[F232]] *Send Data back to Algorithm*: The managed data is then sent to be computed by the detection component. (F232)

*Non-Functional Requirements:*

. [[NF231]] *Speed and Latency*: The Kinect manager is able to send back the RGB and depth data in 60-80 ms. (NF231)

. [[NF232]] *Accuracy*: The Kinect must be able to correctly cut out the noise effectively by 85%. (NF232)
