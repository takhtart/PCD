.Detection Algorithm State Machine
image::models/state.png[scale=70%,align="center"]

The application is composed of 2 software components:

- *Human Detection Algorithm*: This component reads in the data from the Kinect manager and provides the location of the human. Based on the provided data it will present the precise location of the hidden person within the environment. The diagram above displays the logic for this detection algorithm. It will loop indefinitely as long as .pcd files are being inputted, either offline or from the Kinect. First the algorithm will attempt to find skin points within the point cloud. Then, it will undergo plane removal and noise removal while sending the original skin points to region growing. Points discovered within the planes/noise will be removed before region growing. After the region of the person is grown, the algorithm will estimate the space occupied by this detected person. Finally, the algorithm will finish and loop back around to start detection on the next frame/file.

- *Human Outline Manager*: This component is responsible for showcasing the Point Cloud Data 
alongside the human outline. The display will visualize the human within 
the 3D environment and provide a rough estimate of the person's location on screen.

The application is composed of 1 hardware component:

- *Kinect Manager*: The Kinect is the main hardware component for the P.C.D application. The Kinect Manager reads the provided Point Cloud Data of the environment. It will then filter out the noise from the data set to provide useful data. Finally sending this data to the algorithm to be processed. The Kinect manager will constantly be filtering and sending data in real time.
